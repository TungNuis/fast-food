We understand the importance of protecting the environment. We have adopted measures such as using environmentally friendly utensils and limiting food waste. We are committed to minimizing the impact of our business operations on the environment. Not only do we provide jobs for many in our community, but we also support social and charitable programs. We pride ourselves on contributing to building a strong and prosperous community. We respect diversity and promote fairness. We are committed to non-discrimination and always creating equal opportunities for all employees and customers. We promote a comfortable work environment and ensure people have the right voice and opportunities. We have developed campaigns to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain. This not only helps conserve resources, but also helps reduce the risk of food disasters.

We understand that fulfilling these commitments is not only our responsibility to society and the environment, but also a way for us to build long-term relationships with customers. We pride ourselves on being part of a sustainable fast food world that supports communities and protects the environment.
